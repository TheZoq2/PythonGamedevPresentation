#Python gamedev presentation
This is a presentation about making games in python I held at LIU before LIU 
gamejam.

A sample game along with all the example code I showed during the presentation
can be found in `game/asteroids.py`.

The talk itself can be found in the `presentation` folder. The slides are generated
using cleaver which makes slides from markdown.
