#Possible game engines

- Pygame
	- Odd doucmentation and has a lot of quirks with rendering, like rotation creating a new image.
	- Maintained and popular

- SDL
	- Very low level, need to use a custom renderer for some things.
	- Probably lacking documentation.
	- No fuzz

- SFML
	- Really nice to work with. Doesn't use any weird event loops or things like that.
	- Outdated and possibly abandoned. Doesn't install from pip and latest git version is broken.

- Panda3d
	- "Real engine"
	- 3d
